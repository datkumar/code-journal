## Git Commit hashes

Git commit hashes are generated automatically by Git using the [`SHA-1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) hash function. These hashes are almost always unique, so you don't need to worry too much about collisions

A number of things are passed into the commit hash function such as:

- Source tree of the commit (which unravels to all the subtrees and blobs)
- Parent commit hash
- Author info
- Committer info
- Commit message

## Git filesystem

Git is a **content-addressable filesystem**. It means you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will return a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content. Git internally uses a [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) (actually a DAG) to maintain the **integrity** of changes made in the repository

Git is made up of [objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) such as commits, branches, tags etc. that are stored in the `.git/objects` directory. To see this, note the hash of your recent commit. Check contents of `.git/objects/` and you'll see some 2-letter folders; find one whose starting characters are that of your commit hashes. Inside them will be files named as rest of your hash characters. These are your commit files. The name splitting is done so as to prevent exceeding the [inode limit](https://www.site24x7.com/learn/linux/inode.html). Check the contents of your commit object file:

```sh title="View a commit object file"
# My commit hash was: 3af19e91c88109c2a47c82c7109fc7eb9055fe77
cat .git/objects/3a/f19e91c88109c2a47c82c7109fc7eb9055fe77
# View a hex dump of that commit object file
xxd .git/objects/3a/f19e91c88109c2a47c82c7109fc7eb9055fe77

# Pretty-print the commit object:
git cat-file -p 3af19e91c88109c2a47c82c7109fc7eb9055fe77
```

The contents would be a bunch of weird raw bytes. This is because Git **compresses** your commits for efficiently sending over the network. There's also the [`git cat-file`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file) plumbing command to view contents of repository objects

We might think Git just stores the changes you made during that commit in the commit information i.e. just the diffs. However, that's not the case:

> On every commit, Git stores a **snapshot** of **ALL** your project files at that point of time in that commit

While taking the entire snapshot, Git does a bunch of performance optimizations so that the size occupied by `.git` folder doesn't get too large. Some of those are:

- Compressing and packing files. Refer [Packfiles](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles)
- De-duplicating files that remain same between commits i.e. if a file didn't change, Git will only store it once
