The **Standard Template Library** (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions

Importing the library: `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`

Some of the key components of the STL include:

1. **Containers**: a range of containers, such as `vector`, `list`, `map`, `stack` which can be used to store and manipulate data.
2. **Algorithms**: a range of algorithms, such as `sort`, `find`, `binary_search`, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
3. **Iterators**: objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container. STL provides a range of iterators, such as `forward_iterator`, `bidirectional_iterator`, and `random_access_iterator`, that can be used with different types of containers.
4. **Function Objects**: Function objects, also known as **functors**, are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms. They provide a way to pass a function to an algorithm, allowing you to customize its behavior.
5. **Adapters**: Adapters are components that modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For example, the `reverse_iterator` adapter can be used to reverse the order of elements in a container.
